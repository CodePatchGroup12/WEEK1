### App Idea Evaluation

Category: Social, Utility

Market: App benifits people who live in different locations and are indecisive on where to meet or simply want to find somewhere that is available

Habit: Not very habit forming but can be used often when every people go out anytime of the week

Scope: Can be done in a small scope among friends but need to use maps in order to get locations that can be searched
